        <h2>What is Vibe Ensemble?</h2>
        <p>
          Vibe Ensemble is a multi-agent coordination system that enables Claude Code to manage specialized AI workers for complex development tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This architecture addresses context drift and focus dilution in complex projects by breaking them down into specialized stages, allowing workers to focus on specific tasks. The high-level planning is left to the coordinator, which serves as a single point of control.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>How it feels to use</h2>
        <p>
          Claude Code becomes your control tower for planning and managing several projects at once. You discuss and approve the plan as usual; once you give sign‑off, the rest runs mostly in the background. You check progress periodically, step in to resolve issues, and keep momentum without micromanaging. Claude Code shifts into a high‑level coordinator that handles the routine. Because it's not writing code or diving into every detail itself, its focus stays sharp and context remains clean for much longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Customization is central:</strong> Worker templates adapt to your team's methodologies, coding standards, and processes. Edit templates in real-time and see changes take effect immediately across all new work.

        <h2>How Vibe-Ensemble Works</h2>
        <p>
          At its core, Vibe-Ensemble operates on a ticket system that breaks down complex projects into manageable, interconnected tasks. Here's how it works:
        </p>

        <h3>The Ticket System</h3>
        <p>
          Every piece of work is represented as a <strong>ticket</strong> that moves through predefined stages. Tickets can be anything from "implement user authentication" to "optimize database queries" or "write API documentation." Each ticket knows:
        </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>What stage it's currently in (planning, design, implementation, testing, review, etc.)</li>
          <li>Which other tickets it depends on</li>
          <li>Which tickets are waiting for it to complete</li>
          <li>Its complete history of what's been done</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ticket Pipelines</h3>
        <p>
          Each ticket follows a <strong>pipeline</strong> - a sequence of stages it must pass through to be completed. Different types of work get different pipelines. For example:
        </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>Feature tickets:</strong> planning → design → implementation → review → deployment</li>
          <li><strong>Bug fix tickets:</strong> planning → implementation → testing → review</li>
          <li><strong>Research tickets:</strong> planning → research → documentation → review</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The beauty is that once a worker completes their stage, the system automatically moves the ticket to the next stage and assigns it to the appropriate specialist worker.
        </p>

        <h3>High-Level Coordination</h3>
        <p>
          When you bring a project to Vibe-Ensemble, you work with a <strong>coordinator</strong> (which is Claude Code in coordinator mode) that:
        </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Understands your project goals and requirements</li>
          <li>Breaks the project into logical epics and stories</li>
          <li>Works with a planning specialist to create a detailed ticket breakdown</li>
          <li>Sets up dependencies between tickets (e.g., "the API must be implemented before the frontend can connect to it")</li>
          <li>Monitors progress and handles any issues that arise</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specialized Workers in Action</h3>
        <p>
          Here's where the magic happens. The <strong>planning worker</strong> takes each epic or story and creates a complete ticket tree with proper dependencies and pipeline assignments. For example, if you want to "add user profiles to the app," the planner might create:
        </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>A design ticket for the user interface mockups</li>
          <li>An implementation ticket for the backend API (depends on design)</li>
          <li>An implementation ticket for the frontend components (depends on API)</li>
          <li>A testing ticket for the complete feature (depends on both implementations)</li>
          <li>A documentation ticket for the new endpoints</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Automatic Workflow</h3>
        <p>
          Once tickets are created, <strong>Vibe-Ensemble runs automatically</strong>. Specialized worker processes (each running their own Claude Code instance) pick up tickets in their area of expertise:
        </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>The <strong>design worker</strong> creates UI mockups and technical specifications</li>
          <li>The <strong>implementation worker</strong> writes the actual code, following the design specs</li>
          <li>The <strong>review worker</strong> examines the code for quality, security, and adherence to standards</li>
          <li>The <strong>testing worker</strong> creates and runs comprehensive tests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each worker <strong>leaves detailed comments</strong> about what they did, what decisions they made, and what the next worker should know. This creates a rich audit trail and ensures knowledge isn't lost between stages.
        </p>

        <h3>Smart Dependencies</h3>
        <p>
          The system automatically respects dependencies. If ticket B depends on ticket A, ticket B won't start until ticket A is completely finished. This prevents workers from stepping on each other's toes and ensures logical ordering of work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even better, when multiple tickets become ready at the same time, multiple workers can operate in parallel, dramatically speeding up development while maintaining quality.
        </p>

        <h3>Your Role as Coordinator</h3>
        <p>
          You stay in control as the coordinator. You can:
        </p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li>Monitor progress in real-time through event feeds and status reports</li>
          <li>Step in to resolve any issues or questions workers encounter</li>
          <li>Adjust priorities or requirements as the project evolves</li>
          <li>Review and approve completed work before final deployment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The result is that complex projects that might take weeks of back-and-forth can be completed in hours or days, with consistent quality and comprehensive documentation of every decision made along the way.
