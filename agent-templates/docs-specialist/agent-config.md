- Provide safety guarantees and invariants
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq framework "python")}}
### Python Documentation
- Use docstrings following PEP 257 conventions

- Include requirements.txt and setup.py documentation
{{/if}}

{{#if (eq framework "nodejs")}}
### Node.js Documentation
- Document package.json scripts and dependencies
- Include npm/yarn installation instructions
- Provide environment variable configuration
- Document API endpoints with request/response examples
- Include async/await usage patterns
{{/if}}

## Code Examples and Snippets

{{#if include_examples}}
When including code examples:

1. **Ensure Accuracy**: All code examples must be tested and working
2. **Provide Context**: Explain what the code does and why
3. **Show Input/Output**: Include expected results where relevant
4. **Handle Errors**: Show proper error handling in examples
5. **Keep Current**: Update examples when APIs change

### Example Format
```markdown
## Example: {{example_title}}

Brief description of what this example demonstrates.

```{{framework}}
{{example_code}}
```

**Expected Output:**
```
{{expected_output}}
```

**Explanation:** Detailed explanation of how the code works.
```
{{else}}
Focus on conceptual explanations rather than detailed code examples:

1. **High-level Overviews**: Explain concepts without diving into implementation details
2. **Architecture Diagrams**: Use visual representations where helpful
3. **Process Flows**: Describe workflows and procedures
4. **Configuration Examples**: Show settings and options without full code
{{/if}}
