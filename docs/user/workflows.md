#### Agent Health Monitoring

**Daily Health Checks**:
1. Navigate to `/agents` in web interface
2. Review agent status indicators:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Green: Agent operational
   - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Agent experiencing minor issues
   - ðŸ”´ Red: Agent disconnected or critical errors
3. Investigate any non-green status agents
4. Check agent performance metrics and response times

**Weekly Health Review**:

2. Analyze trends in availability and performance
3. Identify agents needing attention or updates
4. Plan maintenance windows for problematic agents

### Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Coordinator-Worker Model
```
Coordinator Agent (Primary)
â”œâ”€â”€ Planning and task distribution
â”œâ”€â”€ Progress monitoring and reporting
â”œâ”€â”€ Escalation handling
â”œâ”€â”€ Resource allocation
â””â”€â”€ Communication with human users

Worker Agents (Multiple)
â”œâ”€â”€ Task execution and completion
â”œâ”€â”€ Status reporting to coordinator
â”œâ”€â”€ Knowledge contribution
â””â”€â”€ Peer collaboration
```

**Typical Workflow**:
1. Human creates issue in web interface
2. Coordinator agent receives notification
3. Coordinator analyzes issue and selects appropriate worker
4. Worker receives task assignment
5. Worker completes task and reports status
6. Coordinator verifies completion and closes issue

## Issue Management Workflows

### Issue Lifecycle Management

#### Standard Issue Processing

**Issue Creation**:
1. **Via Web Interface**:
   - Navigate to `/issues/new`
   - Fill in title, description, and priority
   - Add relevant labels and assign if known
   - Submit and verify creation

2. **Via API Integration**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-server.com/api/issues \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "title": "Fix authentication timeout",
       "description": "Users experiencing session timeouts after 5 minutes",
       "priority": "High",
       "assigned_agent_id": null
     }'
   ```

**Issue Assignment**:
1. **Manual Assignment**:
   - Review available agents and their current workload
   - Consider agent capabilities vs issue requirements
   - Assign through web interface or API
   - Notify assigned agent

2. **Automatic Assignment** (if configured):
   - System evaluates agent capabilities
   - Considers current workload distribution
   - Assigns based on availability and expertise
   - Sends notification to assigned agent

**Issue Tracking**:
1. Monitor progress through status updates
2. Review agent comments and updates
3. Communicate with assigned agent if needed
4. Verify completion before closing

#### Priority-Based Workflows

**Critical Issues (Immediate Response)**:
1. Issue automatically flagged for immediate attention
2. Notification sent to all available agents
3. First available agent claims the issue
4. Hourly progress updates required
5. Escalation to human coordinator if no progress in 2 hours

**High Priority Issues (Same Day)**:
1. Assigned to best-fit agent within 1 hour
2. Target completion within 8 hours
3. Progress updates every 2 hours
4. Escalation if not resolved within SLA

**Medium/Low Priority (Standard Processing)**:
1. Assigned based on agent availability
2. Standard completion timeframes
3. Progress updates at key milestones
4. Regular review in weekly planning

### Issue Resolution Patterns

   - Validates against original issue description
   - Confirms no side effects

4. **Deployment**:
   - Merges to main branch
   - Deploys to staging environment
   - Verifies fix in production-like environment
   - Deploys to production

5. **Closure**:
   - Updates issue status to resolved
   - Adds resolution notes
   - Notifies reporter of resolution
   - Closes issue after confirmation
