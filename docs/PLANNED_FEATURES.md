# Planned Features

This document outlines features planned for future development in the vibe-ensemble-mcp system.

## Advanced Git Integration (Phase 2)

**Status**: Planned for future implementation
**Prerequisites**: Phase 1 Git Integration (basic repository management, commit workflows, conflict detection)

### Overview
Advanced git workflow management capabilities that extend beyond basic commit tracking to provide comprehensive version control integration for multi-agent development workflows.

### Features

#### 1. Git Commit Audit Events
- **Description**: Integrate git commits into the event system for complete audit trails
- **Benefits**:
  - Track which worker made which commits across all projects
  - Correlate commits with worker completion events
  - Enable rollback tracking and change attribution at the system level
- **Implementation**: Emit events when workers successfully commit changes, including commit hash, worker ID, and conventional commit message

#### 2. Branch Management for Complex Workflows
- **Description**: Intelligent branch management for feature development and parallel work streams
- **Features**:
  - Automatic feature branch creation for complex tickets
  - Branch merging strategies when tickets complete
  - Parallel development coordination across multiple tickets
  - Integration with ticket dependencies and blocking relationships
- **Use Cases**: Large features spanning multiple stages, hotfix workflows, experimental development

#### 3. Pre-commit Hooks Integration
- **Description**: Automated validation and formatting before commits
- **Features**:
  - Code formatting enforcement (language-specific)
  - Lint checking and automated fixes
  - Conventional commit message validation at git level
  - Custom project-specific validation rules
- **Integration**: Hook into existing worker validation workflows

#### 4. Remote Repository Integration
- **Description**: Seamless integration with remote git repositories (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
- **Features**:
  - Automatic pushing of completed work
  - Pull request/merge request creation for completed tickets
  - Remote conflict detection and resolution workflows
  - Integration with CI/CD pipelines
  - Synchronization with remote changes during development

### Technical Considerations

#### Security
- Secure credential management for remote repositories
- Permission validation for push/pull operations
- Isolation of worker git operations

#### Performance
- Efficient git operations that don't block worker processing
- Background synchronization with remote repositories
- Optimized git status checking and change detection

#### Reliability
- Recovery mechanisms for failed git operations
- Rollback capabilities for problematic commits
- Backup strategies for local git repositories

### Integration Points

#### Event System
- New event types: `git_commit_created`, `branch_created`, `merge_completed`, `remote_sync_completed`
- Enhanced event metadata with git-specific information
- Correlation between git events and worker lifecycle events

#### Worker Templates
- Enhanced git workflow instructions
- Branch-aware development patterns
- Remote repository interaction guidelines
- Advanced conflict resolution strategies

#### Coordinator Tools
- Git repository management tools
- Branch visualization and management
- Remote repository configuration and monitoring
- Git history analysis and reporting

### Success Metrics
- Reduced git-related worker failures
- Improved traceability of changes across development cycles
- Seamless integration with existing development workflows
- Enhanced collaboration capabilities for multi-agent development

### Dependencies
- Completion of Phase 1 Git Integration
- Enhanced worker template system
- Extended event system capabilities
- Remote repository access and credentials management
