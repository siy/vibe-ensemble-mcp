## Current Status Summary

### Completed ‚úÖ
- **Documentation Phase**: All planning documents created
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed stage breakdowns ready

### Next Actions üéØ
1. **Create CLAUDE.md** - Context preservation document
2. **Begin Stage 1** - Project setup and basic HTTP server
3. **Sequential Implementation** - Follow stage-by-stage approach

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Functionality**: All 25 MCP tools working
- **Performance**: <100ms MCP response time, <50ms DB queries
- **Reliability**: Graceful error handling, process management
- **Testing**: 100% integration test coverage

### Success Criteria
- ‚úÖ Coordinator can manage projects and worker types
- ‚è≥ Workers spawn/stop successfully with status tracking
- ‚è≥ Complete ticket lifecycle with multi-stage processing
- ‚è≥ Event system notifies coordinator of completions
- ‚è≥ System handles 10+ concurrent workers reliably

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- **Sequential Stages**: Complete each stage before moving to next
- **Incremental Testing**: Validate functionality at each stage
- **Documentation Updates**: Keep docs current with implementation
- **Progress Tracking**: Update this TODO.md regularly

### Quality Gates
- Each stage must pass validation checklist before proceeding
- Integration tests must pass before stage completion
- Documentation must be updated with implementation details
- Performance benchmarks must be met at each stage

### Risk Mitigation
- Mock worker processes during testing (avoid actual Claude Code spawning)
- Use temporary databases for testing (avoid data corruption)
- Implement graceful degradation for failed operations
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
