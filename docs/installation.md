If you prefer to build from source or want to contribute:

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.80 or later
- Git

### Build Steps

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/siy/vibe-ensemble-mcp.git
cd vibe-ensemble-mcp

## Verify Installation

Check that Vibe Ensemble is properly installed:

```bash
vibe-ensemble --version
```

You should see output like:
```
vibe-ensemble 0.4.0
```

- Print startup information

You should see:
```
üöÄ Vibe Ensemble started successfully
üìä Web dashboard: http://127.0.0.1:8080
üíæ Database: (see Data Directory section)
  - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/vibe-ensemble/data.db
  - Linux: ~/.local/share/vibe-ensemble/data.db
  - Windows: %APPDATA%/vibe-ensemble/data.db
üîß Configuration: Default settings
```

## Connect to Claude Code

### Option 1: Claude Code Settings UI

1. Open Claude Code
2. Go to Settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
3. Navigate to "MCP Servers"
4. Click "Add Server"
5. Enter:
   - **Name**: `vibe-ensemble`
   - **Command**: `vibe-ensemble --mcp-only --transport=stdio`

### Option 2: Configuration File

Add to your Claude Code MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-ensemble": {
      "command": "vibe-ensemble --mcp-only --transport=stdio",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

The configuration file is typically located at:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude Code/mcp_settings.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude-code/mcp_settings.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/Claude Code/mcp_settings.json`

## Configuration

Vibe Ensemble works with zero configuration, but you can customize it:

### Command Line Options

```bash
# Run on different port
vibe-ensemble --port=9000

# Disable web dashboard
vibe-ensemble --mcp-only --transport=stdio

# Use custom database location
DATABASE_URL="sqlite://./my-project.db" vibe-ensemble
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Database location (file path)
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:///path/to/my-database.db"

# In-memory database
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite::memory:"

# Server port
export VIBE_ENSEMBLE_PORT=9000

# Log level
export RUST_LOG=info
```

## Data Directory

Vibe Ensemble stores its data in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/vibe-ensemble/`
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/vibe-ensemble/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%/vibe-ensemble/`

This directory contains:
- `data.db` - SQLite database with agents, issues, and knowledge
- `logs/` - Application logs (if file logging is enabled)

## Updating

### Quick Update (if installed via script)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://vibeensemble.dev/install.sh | bash  # or download + verify as above
```

### Manual Update

1. Download the new binary from releases
2. Replace the existing binary
3. Restart Vibe Ensemble

Your data and configuration will be preserved.

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see "Address already in use" error:

```bash
# Find what's using port 8080
lsof -i :8080  # macOS/Linux
netstat -ano | findstr :8080  # Windows

# Use a different port
vibe-ensemble --port=8081
```

### Permission Denied

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Fix binary permissions
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/vibe-ensemble

# Fix data directory permissions  
chmod -R 755 ~/.local/share/vibe-ensemble/
```

**Windows:**
- Run Command Prompt as Administrator
- Ensure the binary is in a writable location

### Database Issues

```bash
# Check database permissions
ls -la ~/.local/share/vibe-ensemble/data.db

# Reset database (‚ö†Ô∏è this deletes all data)
rm ~/.local/share/vibe-ensemble/data.db
vibe-ensemble  # Will recreate empty database
```

### Connection Issues with Claude Code

1. Verify Vibe Ensemble is running:
   ```bash
   curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/health
   ```

2. Check Claude Code MCP configuration
3. Restart Claude Code after adding the MCP server

## Uninstalling

To completely remove Vibe Ensemble:

```bash
# Remove binary
sudo rm /usr/local/bin/vibe-ensemble

# Remove data directory
rm -rf ~/.local/share/vibe-ensemble/
```
