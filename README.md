# Vibe Ensemble MCP Server

A comprehensive MCP (Model Context Protocol) server in Rust for coordinating multiple Claude Code instances with distributed task execution, unified management, communication, and issue tracking.

## Overview

Vibe Ensemble is an advanced MCP server that serves as the central coordination hub for multiple Claude Code instances, featuring intelligent coordination AI, enabling:

- **Intelligent Agent Coordination**: AI-powered dependency detection, conflict resolution, and escalation management
- **Distributed Task Execution**: Seamless work coordination across multiple AI agents with proactive monitoring
- **Cross-Project Integration**: Advanced tools for managing dependencies and coordination across project boundaries
- **Real-time Communication**: Sophisticated messaging with structured protocols and coordination awareness
- **Issue Tracking**: Persistent task and problem management with intelligent workflow automation
- **Knowledge-Driven Decisions**: Pattern recognition and organizational learning for continuous improvement
- **Dynamic Prompt Management**: Advanced AI behavior configuration with coordination specialists

## Architecture

The system is built around five core subsystems:

1. **Agent Management System** - Registration, lifecycle, and capability tracking
2. **Issue Tracking System** - Persistent storage and workflow management
3. **Messaging System** - Real-time communication with standardized protocols
4. **Knowledge Management System** - Development patterns and organizational knowledge
5. **Persistence Layer** - Data consistency and recovery across all subsystems

### Intelligent Agent Hierarchy

- **Coordinator Agent**: Enhanced with intelligent coordination prompts featuring dependency detection, conflict resolution protocols, and automated escalation management
- **Worker Agents**: Execute tasks with coordination awareness, proactive dependency detection, and intelligent escalation protocols  
- **Specialist Coordinators**: Cross-project coordinators, conflict resolvers, and escalation managers for complex multi-agent scenarios

All agents use MCP coordination tools: `vibe/dependency/analyze`, `vibe/conflict/detect`, `vibe/agent/message`, `vibe/coordination/escalate`.

### Binary Download
Download the latest release for your platform from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/siy/vibe-ensemble-mcp/releases/latest).

### Starting the Server

After installation, start the Vibe Ensemble server:

```bash
vibe-ensemble
```

The server will start with:
- **Web Dashboard**: http://127.0.0.1:8081 (system monitoring, agent management)
- **API Endpoints**: http://127.0.0.1:8080 (health, stats, coordination)
- **MCP Server**: Running on configured transport (WebSocket/stdio)

## Claude Code Setup

### 1. Configure Claude Code MCP Settings

Add the Vibe Ensemble MCP server to your Claude Code configuration:

**Option A: Using Claude Code Settings UI**
1. Open Claude Code settings (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)
2. Navigate to "MCP Servers"
3. Add a new server with:
   - **Name**: `vibe-ensemble`
   - **Command**: `vibe-ensemble --mcp-only --transport=stdio`
   - **Args**: `--transport=stdio`

**Option B: Direct Configuration File**
Add to your Claude Code MCP settings file (`~/.config/claude-code/mcp_settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vibe-ensemble": {
      "command": "vibe-ensemble --mcp-only --transport=stdio",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Available MCP Tools

Once configured, Claude Code will have access to 42+ coordination tools including:

**Agent Management:**
- `vibe/agent/register` - Register a new agent with capabilities
- `vibe/agent/list` - List all registered agents
- `vibe/agent/message` - Send messages between agents

**Task Coordination:**
- `vibe/task/create` - Create and assign tasks
- `vibe/task/update` - Update task status and progress
- `vibe/dependency/analyze` - Analyze task dependencies
- `vibe/conflict/detect` - Detect and resolve conflicts

**Knowledge Management:**
- `vibe/knowledge/store` - Store development patterns and insights
- `vibe/knowledge/search` - Search organizational knowledge base
- `vibe/guideline/enforce` - Apply organizational standards

### 3. Multi-Agent Coordination

For teams using multiple Claude Code instances:

1. **Each agent registers automatically** when first using vibe tools
2. **Coordinate work** using `vibe/coordination/escalate` for complex tasks
3. **Share knowledge** through the centralized knowledge base
4. **Monitor progress** via the web dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8081

### Building from Source (Development)

If you prefer to build from source or contribute to development:

1. **Prerequisites**: Rust 1.80+, SQLite, Git
2. **Clone and build**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siy/vibe-ensemble-mcp.git
   cd vibe-ensemble-mcp
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. **Run**: `cargo run --bin vibe-ensemble`

### Configuration

The server uses a hierarchical configuration system:

- **Global defaults**: Built-in sensible defaults
- **Environment files**: `.env` for local development
- **Environment variables**: Override for deployment
- **Runtime configuration**: Database-stored settings

Example configuration:

```toml
[server]
host = "127.0.0.1"
port = 8080
max_connections = 1000

[database]
url = "sqlite:vibe-ensemble.db"
max_connections = 10

[mcp]
transport = "websocket"
timeout_seconds = 30
```
