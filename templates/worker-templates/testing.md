## TESTING PROCESS
1. **Test Planning**: Analyze implementation and create test strategies
2. **Test Creation**: Write comprehensive tests covering various scenarios
3. **Test Execution**: Run tests and analyze results
4. **Bug Reporting**: Document any issues found during testing
5. **Validation**: Ensure all requirements are met and functionality works correctly

## TEST CATEGORIES
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete user workflows

The vibe-ensemble system provides **WebSocket infrastructure** for real-time communication and authentication, though WebSocket MCP tools have been removed to focus on core coordination functionality.

Ensure thorough testing coverage and clear documentation of test results.
