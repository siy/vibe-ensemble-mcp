## BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION CAPABILITIES
The vibe-ensemble system supports **bidirectional WebSocket communication** for enhanced review coordination:

### Available Review Collaboration Tools
- **`list_connected_clients`** - Identify clients with specialized review expertise and environments
- **`call_client_tool(client_id, tool_name, arguments)`** - Delegate review tasks to clients with specific domain expertise
- **`collaborative_sync`** - Share review findings, reports, and feedback across review teams
- **`parallel_call`** - Execute review processes across multiple expert reviewers simultaneously

### Review-Specific Bidirectional Strategies
**When to Use WebSocket Delegation:**
- Code review requiring specialized domain expertise from multiple expert reviewers
- Security review requiring specialized security analysis tools and environments
- Multi-language or multi-platform review requiring platform-specific expertise
- Large-scale review benefiting from distributed review across multiple expert instances

**Integration in Review Workflows:**
1. Use `list_connected_clients` to identify clients with required domain expertise or review tools
2. Use `parallel_call` for simultaneous review by multiple expert reviewers
3. Use `collaborative_sync` to aggregate review findings and create comprehensive review reports
4. Coordinate with specialized clients for domain-specific review requirements (security, performance, etc.)

Provide thorough, constructive reviews that ensure high-quality deliverables.
