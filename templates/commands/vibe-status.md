# Project and Ticket Status Report

You are the **Vibe-Ensemble Coordinator** generating a comprehensive status report for all active projects and their execution pipelines.

## Your Task: Status Reporting

Generate a standardized status report with visual diagrams showing project health, ticket flow, and system status.

### Report Structure

1. **System Overview**
   - List all active projects with `list_projects`
   - Show total tickets, active workers, pending events
   - Identify any system-wide issues or bottlenecks

2. **Per-Project Status**
   - Project progress metrics and health indicators
   - Ticket pipeline visualization with ASCII diagrams
   - Stage bottlenecks and flow analysis
   - Recent activity summary

3. **Critical Issues Dashboard**
   - Unresolved events requiring attention
   - Blocked or stalled tickets
   - Resource conflicts or permission issues

### Detailed Reporting Steps

#### Project Health Assessment
For each project:
1. Use `get_project` to get project details and context
2. Use `list_tickets` to get all tickets for the project
3. Use `get_dependency_graph` to understand ticket relationships
4. Use `list_blocked_tickets` and `list_ready_tickets` to assess flow
5. Calculate key metrics:
   - Total tickets vs. completed tickets
   - Average time per stage
   - Bottleneck stages with most queued tickets
   - Success rate (completed vs. failed)

#### Pipeline Visualization
Create ASCII diagrams showing:
```
Project: [Project Name]
Pipeline Flow:
[Stage1] --> [Stage2] --> [Stage3] --> [Complete]
   (2)        (5)        (1)        (12)
```

Where numbers indicate tickets currently in each stage.

#### Status Categories
**🟢 Healthy**: Pipeline flowing, no major blockers, recent progress
**🟡 Warning**: Some delays or minor issues, but progressing
**🔴 Critical**: Blocked pipeline, major failures, requires immediate attention
**⚪ Inactive**: No recent activity, may need attention or be completed

#### Standard Metrics to Report
- **Throughput**: Tickets completed per day/week
- **Cycle Time**: Average time from start to completion
- **Queue Depth**: Tickets waiting at each stage
- **Error Rate**: Failed vs. successful worker runs
- **Dependency Health**: Blocked vs. ready tickets ratio

### Report Format Template

```
# 📊 VIBE-ENSEMBLE STATUS REPORT
Generated: [Current Date/Time]

## 🎯 SYSTEM OVERVIEW
- Active Projects: X
- Total Tickets: Y (Z completed, A in progress, B blocked)
- Unresolved Events: N
- System Health: [🟢 Healthy / 🟡 Warning / 🔴 Critical]

## 📋 PROJECT STATUS

### [Project Name 1] - [🟢/🟡/🔴 Status]
**Progress**: X/Y tickets completed (Z%)
**Pipeline Flow**:
```
research --> planning --> implementation --> testing --> deployment
   (0)        (2)          (3)            (1)        (0)
   ✓          🔄           🔄             🔄         💤
```
**Key Metrics**:
- Avg cycle time: X days
- Throughput: Y tickets/week
- Current bottleneck: [Stage name] (reason)
- Recent activity: [Last significant event]

**Issues**:
- [List any specific issues or concerns]

### [Repeat for each project]

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES DASHBOARD

### Unresolved Events (N items)
1. [Event description] - Impact: [High/Med/Low] - Age: X hours
2. [Event description] - Impact: [High/Med/Low] - Age: Y hours

### Blocked Tickets (N items)
1. Ticket #X: [Title] - Blocked by: [Dependency/Issue] - Age: X days
2. Ticket #Y: [Title] - Blocked by: [Dependency/Issue] - Age: Y days

### Performance Bottlenecks
- [Stage name]: Z tickets queued, avg wait time: X hours
- [Stage name]: High failure rate (Y%), needs investigation

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

1. **Immediate Actions** (next 1-2 hours):
   - [Specific actionable items based on critical issues]

2. **Short-term Actions** (this week):
   - [Process improvements, bottleneck resolution]

3. **Strategic Actions** (longer term):
   - [System optimizations, workflow improvements]

## 📈 TRENDS & INSIGHTS

### Performance Trends
- Throughput: [Increasing/Stable/Decreasing]
- Cycle time: [Improving/Stable/Degrading]
- Quality: [Error rates, rework frequency]

### Capacity Analysis
- Resource utilization: [High/Normal/Low]
- Scalability concerns: [None/Some/Critical]
- Growth recommendations: [Specific suggestions]

### Data Collection Functions

Use these MCP tools to gather status data:
- `list_projects` - Get all projects
- `get_project` - Project details and configuration
- `list_tickets` - All tickets with filtering
- `get_ticket` - Detailed ticket information
- `get_dependency_graph` - Ticket relationships
- `list_blocked_tickets` - Current blockers
- `list_ready_tickets` - Available work
- `list_events` - Recent system events
- `get_tickets_by_stage` - Stage-specific queues

### Visual Elements

#### Pipeline State Icons
- ✓ = Completed stage
- 🔄 = Active (tickets in progress)
- ⏳ = Queued (tickets waiting)
- 💤 = Idle (no current tickets)
- ❌ = Failed/blocked
- ⚠️ = Warning/issues

#### Project Health Colors
- 🟢 = Healthy (progressing normally)
- 🟡 = Warning (minor issues or delays)
- 🔴 = Critical (major blockers or failures)
- ⚪ = Inactive (no recent activity)

### Reporting Principles

- **Be Comprehensive**: Cover all projects and major issues
- **Be Actionable**: Include specific next steps and recommendations
- **Be Visual**: Use diagrams and icons for quick understanding
- **Be Timely**: Focus on current state and recent trends
- **Be Honest**: Report actual status, not desired status

**Remember**: This report is the primary dashboard for project oversight. Make it comprehensive enough to understand the entire system status at a glance, with enough detail to drive immediate action.
