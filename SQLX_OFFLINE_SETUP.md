# SQLx Offline Mode Configuration

## Problem Solved

Fixed CI compilation issues where SQLx macros were attempting to connect to a database during build time, causing:
```
error: error returned from database: (code: 14) unable to open database file
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Generated Query Cache Files
- **Storage crate**: 35 query cache files in `vibe-ensemble-storage/.sqlx/`
- **Security crate**: 50 query cache files in `vibe-ensemble-security/.sqlx/`
- **Workspace level**: 2 additional query cache files in `.sqlx/`

### 2. CI Configuration Updates
Updated both CI workflows to use offline mode:
- `.github/workflows/comprehensive-testing.yml`
- `.github/workflows/production-deployment.yml`

Added environment variable: `SQLX_OFFLINE: true`

### 3. Database Setup for Cache Generation
```bash
export DATABASE_URL="sqlite:/path/to/database.db"
sqlx database create
sqlx migrate run --source vibe-ensemble-storage/migrations
cargo sqlx prepare  # Run in each crate directory
```

### 4. Verification
Both SQLx-using crates now compile successfully in offline mode:
```bash
SQLX_OFFLINE=true cargo check --package vibe-ensemble-storage --package vibe-ensemble-security
```

## Files Modified
- Added 52 new SQLx query cache files across crates
- Updated 2 GitHub Actions workflow files
- Committed as: `fix: enable SQLx offline mode for CI compilation`

## Result
- CI builds no longer attempt database connections during compilation
- All SQLx query macros are validated using pre-generated cache files
- Consistent builds between local development and CI environments
- Future-proof setup for ongoing SQLx usage

## Maintenance Notes
- Query cache files should be regenerated when SQL schema changes
- Use `cargo sqlx prepare` after modifying database queries
- Cache files are version controlled and must be kept in sync with code
