cargo test --workspace

# Run specific test
cargo test <test_name>

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run clippy linter
cargo clippy

# Run clippy with strict warnings (CI requirement)
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features

# Check compilation without building
cargo check

# Security audit (CI requirement)
cargo audit

# Clean build artifacts
cargo clean

# Start the unified server (default: API + Web Dashboard + MCP WebSocket + SSE)
cargo run --bin vibe-ensemble

# Start in MCP-only mode with WebSocket transport (for multi-agent coordination)

### Agent Hierarchy & Coordination Intelligence

- **Coordinator Agent** - Enhanced with intelligent coordination prompts featuring dependency detection, conflict resolution protocols, and automated escalation management
- **Worker Agents** - Execute tasks with coordination awareness, proactive dependency detection, and intelligent escalation protocols
- **Specialist Coordinators** - Cross-project coordinators, conflict resolvers, and escalation managers for complex multi-agent scenarios

The system features knowledge-driven coordination with pattern recognition, automated conflict detection, intelligent escalation decision trees, and cross-project dependency orchestration. All agents use MCP tools for seamless coordination: `vibe/dependency/analyze`, `vibe/conflict/detect`, `vibe/agent/message`, `vibe/coordination/escalate`.

## Knowledge Management & Coordination Intelligence

The system includes a comprehensive knowledge repository enhanced with coordination intelligence:
- **Pattern Recognition** - Automatically detects and suggests proven coordination strategies
- **Development Standards** - Enforces organizational guidelines via `vibe/guideline/enforce`
- **Conflict History** - Learns from past conflicts to prevent recurring issues
- **Cross-Project Learning** - Shares coordination patterns across project boundaries
- **Intelligent Escalation** - Data-driven escalation decisions based on historical outcomes
- **Proactive Monitoring** - Continuous scanning for dependency violations and conflicts

## Configuration

The project includes Claude Code-specific configuration in `.claude/settings.local.json` with pre-approved permissions for common Rust development commands and git operations.

## GitHub Integration

This project leverages the GitHub MCP server for streamlined development workflows. Always use the GitHub MCP tools for:

### CI/CD Monitoring
- **Check workflow status**: Use `mcp__github__list_workflow_runs` to monitor CI progress
- **Debug failures**: Use `mcp__github__get_job_logs` with `failed_only=true` for efficient debugging
- **View specific runs**: Use `mcp__github__get_workflow_run` for detailed run information

### Issue and PR Management  
- **Track issues**: Use `mcp__github__list_issues` and `mcp__github__get_issue` for issue management
- **Monitor PRs**: Use `mcp__github__list_pull_requests` and `mcp__github__get_pull_request` for code review
- **Check PR status**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_status` before merging

### Security and Quality Assurance
- **Security alerts**: Use `mcp__github__list_dependabot_alerts` to monitor dependency vulnerabilities
- **Code scanning**: Use `mcp__github__list_code_scanning_alerts` for security analysis
- **Release management**: Use `mcp__github__list_releases` and `mcp__github__get_latest_release` for version tracking

### Best Practices
- **Proactive monitoring**: Check CI status after pushing changes
- **Efficient debugging**: Use failed_only logs instead of full workflow logs
- **Security awareness**: Regularly check for security alerts and dependency issues
- **Release readiness**: Verify all checks pass before creating releases

Example workflow:
```bash
# After pushing changes, check CI status
mcp__github__list_workflow_runs owner=siy repo=vibe-ensemble-mcp workflow_id=ci.yml

# If CI fails, get failure details  
mcp__github__get_job_logs owner=siy repo=vibe-ensemble-mcp run_id=<run_id> failed_only=true

# Check for security issues
mcp__github__list_dependabot_alerts owner=siy repo=vibe-ensemble-mcp
```

## Dual Transport (WebSocket + SSE) for Multi-Agent Coordination

The dual-transport architecture provides optimal multi-agent coordination capabilities:

### Key Features
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance**: Strict validation of message format and protocol version over WebSocket frames
- **Multi-Agent Support**: Concurrent connections for multiple Claude Code instances
- **SSE Message Delivery**: Server-Sent Events for reliable coordinator-worker communication
- **Auto-Approval Workflow**: Seamless coordinator approval of worker permissions
- **Connection Lifecycle**: Proper WebSocket upgrade protocol and connection management
- **MCP Protocol State Tracking**: Initialization sequence management and protocol compliance
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient message handling with configurable timeouts
- **Robust Error Handling**: WebSocket frame handling, reconnection support, and graceful degradation
- **Resource Management**: Proper WebSocket close frames and connection cleanup

### Configuration Options

```rust
// Default WebSocket transport
let transport = TransportFactory::websocket(websocket);

// Custom configuration for specific requirements
let transport = TransportFactory::websocket_with_config(
    websocket,
    Duration::from_secs(30),    // Read timeout
    Duration::from_secs(10),    // Write timeout  
    Some(remote_addr),          // Remote address for logging
);
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Connection Handling**: Multiple concurrent WebSocket connections
- **Read Timeout**: 30 seconds (prevents indefinite blocking)
- **Write Timeout**: 10 seconds (ensures responsive communication)
- **WebSocket Frames**: Efficient binary and text frame handling
- **Message Validation**: JSON-RPC 2.0 compliance validation

### Multi-Agent Coordination
The dual-transport system enables advanced multi-agent scenarios:
- Supports all MCP protocol methods (initialize, tools/list, tools/call, resources/list, etc.)
- Handles multiple concurrent agent connections with SSE updates
- Provides proper error responses with JSON-RPC 2.0 error format
- Supports coordination tools for agent communication
- Enables distributed task execution and collaboration
- Automated permission approval workflow between coordinators and workers

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Dual-transport MCP server for multi-agent coordination (WebSocket + SSE)
cargo run --bin vibe-ensemble -- --mcp-only

# With custom database for persistent state
DATABASE_URL="sqlite:./multi-agent.db" cargo run --bin vibe-ensemble

# Debug mode with enhanced logging
RUST_LOG=vibe_ensemble_mcp=debug cargo run --bin vibe-ensemble -- --mcp-only
```

## Development Focus

When working on this codebase:
- Follow idiomatic Rust patterns with ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes
- Use the type system for correctness and zero-cost abstractions
- Implement explicit error handling with Result types
- Leverage async/await for concurrent operations
- Include comprehensive tests and documentation
- **Special Attention**: Keep attribution in only one place - README.md. Attribution in commits or PR's is strictly prohibited.
- **Special Attention**: Strictly follow single line convenient commits convention for commit messages.

## Task Implementation Protocol

**MANDATORY: Always use ticket-implementer agent for ALL implementation tasks**, regardless of task source:

### Task Sources Requiring ticket-implementer:
- **GitHub Issues**: Any issue from the repository issue tracker
- **Direct User Tasks**: Tasks provided directly by the user in conversation
- **Follow-up Work**: PR comments, CI fixes, refactoring requests
- **Feature Requests**: New functionality or enhancements
- **Bug Reports**: Any debugging or fixing work
- **Code Reviews**: Implementing review feedback

### ticket-implementer Usage:
```markdown
Use ticket-implementer for:
- Initial task analysis and planning
- Implementation with fresh start protocol
- Quality assurance and testing
- PR creation and management
- Review comment resolution
- CI issue debugging and fixes
```

### Quality Assurance Requirements (MANDATORY):
**CRITICAL**: Before each and every commit, ticket-implementer MUST verify:
1. **Tests Pass**: `cargo test --workspace` - All tests must pass without failures
2. **Clippy Clean**: `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` - No warnings or errors allowed
3. **Formatting Applied**: `cargo fmt` - Code must be properly formatted
4. **Build Success**: `cargo build` - Project must compile without errors

**Zero Tolerance Policy**: No commit is allowed if any of these checks fail. The ticket-implementer must fix all issues before proceeding.

### Fresh Start Protocol (Mandatory):
Every task MUST begin with:
1. `git checkout main`
2. `git pull origin main` 
3. Create new feature branch
4. Systematic implementation following project standards

### ticket-implementer Instructions (ALWAYS INCLUDE):
When using ticket-implementer, ALWAYS include this mandatory instruction in the prompt:

**"CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Before each commit, you MUST run and verify ALL of the following pass without any errors or warnings:
- `cargo test --workspace` (all tests must pass)
- `RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features` (no warnings allowed)
- `cargo fmt` (formatting must be applied)
- `cargo build` (must compile successfully)

No commit is permitted if any of these checks fail. Fix all issues before committing."**

**No Exceptions**: ticket-implementer handles ALL coding tasks to ensure consistency, quality, and proper workflow adherence across the entire development process.

## Git Worktree Workflow

This project supports parallel development using git worktrees for multiple worker agents:

### Worker Agent Coordination
- **Workers can work on multiple projects in parallel** using separate worktrees
- **Workers on the same project use git worktrees** to avoid conflicts
- Use descriptive worktree names: `../project-agent-feature-name`

### Common Worktree Commands
```bash
# Create worktree for new feature
git worktree add -b feature-name ../vibe-ensemble-feature

# List active worktrees
git worktree list

# Clean up completed work
git worktree remove ../vibe-ensemble-feature
```

### Best Practices
- **One primary worktree per active development task**
- **Temporary worktrees for experimentation**
- **Regular cleanup** of completed worktrees
- **Descriptive naming** to indicate purpose and agent

See [docs/git-worktrees.md](docs/git-worktrees.md) for comprehensive worktree usage patterns.
