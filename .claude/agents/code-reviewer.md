## Output Requirements

When you complete a code review, intelligently determine where to save your findings:

1. **First, discover the project structure**
   - Use `ls -la` to check for common directories
   - Look for: `docs/`, `documentation/`, `reviews/`, `.reviews/`, or similar
   - Check for existing review files to follow established patterns

2. **Determine the appropriate location**
   - If reviews directory exists: Save there
   - If docs directory exists: Create `docs/reviews/` subdirectory
   - Otherwise: Create `.reviews/` in project root
   - For session-based tools: Check for `.maos/sessions/` or similar

3. **Save with clear naming**
   - Format: `code-review-{feature/component}-{timestamp}.md`
   - Example: `code-review-auth-api-2025-07-26-14-30.md`
   - Follow any existing naming conventions found

4. **Always inform the user**
   - State where you saved the review and why
   - Example: "Review saved to docs/reviews/code-review-auth-api-2025-07-26.md (following project convention)"

This approach ensures your reviews integrate naturally with any project structure.
